# HTML  TO DOC AND DOC TO PDF CONVERSION

### Web-scrapping, doc creation,  pdf conversion in python

> HII Guys, Today I found a faster or fastest version of html to doc conversion for both small html files as well as big html files. In python, if we get this kind of tasks we fast look for available libraries which are good but it will fail for large files. 
You then can go with paid libraries , sure you can, but if you want to html to doc conversion with free version, so you come at right place.

> I also tried to find all available libraries of html to doc conversion but for big html files all failed, I wondered how online platforms doing and I came up with a cool idea why to convert using libs we can create from scratch.

> What I did, I read html tags tag by tag using beautiful soup and after reading I created doc using python docx lib and filled the tag data in it. Created doc then also converted to pdf using docx2pdf lib.

> Right now tag reading is for few standard tag you can modify and update it as per your requirement.

> Mentioned file is a sample illustration.
